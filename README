NAME
    CDDB::File - Parse a CDDB/freedb data file

SYNOPSIS
      my $disc = CDDB::File->new("rock/f4109511");

      print $disc->id, $disc->all_ids;
      print $disc->artist, $disc->title;
      print $disc->year, $disc->genre, $disc->extd;
      print $disc->length, $disc->track_count;
  
      print $disc->revision, $disc->submitted_via, $disc->processed_by;

      foreach my $track ($disc->tracks) {
        print $track->number, $track->title, $track->artist;
        print $track->length, $track->extd;
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an interface for extracting data from CDDB-format
    data files, as used by freedb.

    It does not read data from your CD, or submit information to freedb.

METHODS
  new
      my $disc = CDDB::File->new("rock/f4109511");

    This will create a new object representing the data in the file name
    specified.

  id / all_ids
      my $discid = $disc->id;
      my @discid = $disc->all_ids;

    Due to how freedb works, one CD may have several IDs associated with it.
    'id' will return the first of these (not necessarily related to the
    filename from which this was read), whilst 'all_ids' will return all of
    them.

  title / artist
    The title and artist of this CD. For eponymous CDs these will be
    identical, even if the data file leaves the artist field blank.

  year
    The (4-digit) year of release.

  genre
    The genre of this CD. This is the genre as stored in the data file
    itself, which is not related to the 11 main freedb genres.

  extd
    The "extended data" for the CD. This is used for storing miscellaneous
    information which has no better storage place, and can be of any length.

  length
    The run time of the CD in seconds.

  track_count
    The number of tracks on the CD.

  revision
    Each time information regarding the CD is updated this revision number
    is incremented. This returns the revision number of this version.

  processed_by / submitted_via
    The software which submitted this information to freedb and which
    processed it at the other end.

  tracks
      foreach my $track ($disc->tracks) {
        print $track->number, $track->title, $track->artist;
        print $track->length, $track->extd;
      }

    Returns a list of Track objects, each of which knows its number
    (numering from 1), title, length (in seconds), offset, and may also have
    extended track data.

    Tracks may also contain an 'artist' field. If this is not set the artist
    method will return the artist of the CD.
